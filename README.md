# ***Mouse Animation 1***
[![Mouse Animation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94090874/207052528-87d1bad4-318e-4b82-aae2-503aad643d3a.png)](https://buggermenot.github.io/Mouse-Animation-1/)
## Simple mouse animation setup made using p5JS.
- Shoots random color blobs around the mouse when the mouse moves. Does nothing otherwise. *Very Satisfying* :relieved::pinched_fingers:.
- Shows a trail whose width dynamically changes with the speed of the mouse. (Slows mouse has a thiner trail).
- Can be easily used as a wallpaper. Try [Lively](https://rocksdanister.github.io/lively/)

## Setup and run
- Download all the files
- Run index.html on your localhost.

## Future plans
- Add suptle lighting behind the mouse as it moves.
- Make background dynamic (Maybe like a space time mesh).
